## Notes Saver React Project

### Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. **NotesSaver.js**: This file contains the functional component `Notes` responsible for rendering a textarea for inputting notes and a button to save the notes as a PDF file. It utilizes React Hooks (`useState`) for managing state and the `jsPDF` library for generating PDFs.

2. **App.js**: This file imports and renders the `Notes` component within the main application. It also includes a title for the application.

### Components

#### NotesSaver.js

##### Functions
- **handleChange**: This function is called when the content of the textarea changes. It updates the `notes` state with the new value.
- **handleSave**: This function is called when the "Save Notes" button is clicked. It creates a new instance of `jsPDF`, adds the notes content to the PDF, and saves the PDF file.

##### Usage

```jsx
<App/>
import Notes from './NotesSaver';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1> NOTES SAVER </h1>
      <Notes/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
